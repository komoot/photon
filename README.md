# photon

[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/komoot/photon/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/komoot/photon/actions)

_photon_ is an open source geocoder built for [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) data. It is based on [elasticsearch](http://elasticsearch.org/) - an efficient, powerful and highly scalable search platform.

_photon_ was started by [komoot](http://www.komoot.de) and provides search-as-you-type and multilingual support. Find our public API and demo on [photon.komoot.io](http://photon.komoot.io). Until October 2020 the API was available under photon.komoot.**de**. Please update your apps accordingly.

### Contribution

All code contributions and bug reports are welcome!

For questions please send an email to our [mailing list](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/photon).

Feel free to test and participate!

### Licence

photon software is open source and licensed under [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

### Features

- high performance
- highly scalability
- search-as-you-type
- multilingual search
- location bias
- typo tolerance
- filter by osm tag and value
- filter by bounding box
- reverse geocode a coordinate to an address
- OSM data import (built upon [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org)) inclusive continuous updates


### Installation

photon requires java, at least version 8.

Download the search index (53G gb compressed, worldwide coverage, languages: English, German, French and local name). The search index is updated weekly and thankfully provided by [GraphHopper](https://www.graphhopper.com/) with the support of [lonvia](https://github.com/lonvia).

Make sure you have bzip2 or pbzip2 installed and execute one of these two commands in your shell. This will download, uncompress and extract the huge database in one step:

 ```bash
wget -O - https://download1.graphhopper.com/public/photon-db-latest.tar.bz2 | bzip2 -cd | tar x
# you can significantly speed up extracting using pbzip2 (recommended):
wget -O - https://download1.graphhopper.com/public/photon-db-latest.tar.bz2 | pbzip2 -cd | tar x
 ```
 
Now get the latest version of photon from
[the releases](https://github.com/komoot/photon/releases) and start it:

```bash
java -jar photon-*.jar
```

Use the `-data-dir` option to point to the parent directory of `photon_data` if that directory is not in the default location `./photon_data`. Before you can send requests to photon, ElasticSearch needs to load some data into memory so be patient for a few seconds.

Check the URL `http://localhost:2322/api?q=berlin` to see if photon is running without problems. You may want to use our [leaflet plugin](https://github.com/komoot/leaflet.photon) to see the results on a map.

To enable CORS (cross-site requests), use `-cors-any` to allow any origin or `-cors-origin` with a specific origin as the argument. By default, CORS support is disabled.

Discover more of photon's feature with its usage `java -jar photon-*.jar -h`.

### Building

photon uses [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for building. To build the package from source make sure you have a JDK and maven installed. Then run:

```
mvn package
```

### Customized Search Data

If you need search data in other languages or restricted to a country you will need to create your search data by your own.
Once you have your [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org) database ready, you can import the data to photon.

If you haven't already set a password for your nominatim database user, do it now (change user name and password as you like, below):

```bash
su postgres
psql
ALTER USER nominatim WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'mysecretpassword';
```
Import the data to photon:
```bash
java -jar photon-*.jar -nominatim-import -host localhost -port 5432 -database nominatim -user nominatim -password mysecretpassword -languages es,fr
```

The import of worldwide data set will take some hours/days, SSD/NVME disks are recommended to accelerate nominatim queries.

#### Updating from OSM via Nominatim

In order to update nominatim from OSM and then photon from nominatim, you must start photon with the nominatim database credentials on the command line:

```bash
java -jar photon-*.jar -host localhost -port 5432 -database nominatim -user nominatim -password ...
```

A nominatim setup is also a requirement to have continuous updates. To keep nominatim in sync with the latest OSM changes and to update photon with nominatim afterwards run:

```bash
export NOMINATIM_DIR=/home/nominatim/...
./continuously_update_from_nominatim.sh
```

If you have updated nominatim with another method, photon can be updated by making a HTTP GET request to `/nominatim-update`, e.g. with this command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:2322/nominatim-update
```


### Search API

#### Search
```
http://localhost:2322/api?q=berlin
```

#### Search with Location Bias
```
http://localhost:2322/api?q=berlin&lon=10&lat=52
```

There are two optional parameters to influence the location bias. 'zoom'
describes the radius around the center to focus on. This is a number that
should correspond roughly to the map zoom parameter of a corresponding map.
The default is `zoom=16`.

The `location_bias_scale` describes how much the prominence of a result should
still be taken into account. Sensible values go from 0.0 (ignore prominence
almost completely) to 1.0 (prominence has approximately the same influence).
The default is 0.2.

```
http://localhost:2322/api?q=berlin&lon=10&lat=52&zoom=12&location_bias_scale=0.1
```

#### Reverse geocode a coordinate
```
http://localhost:2322/reverse?lon=10&lat=52
```

#### Adapt Number of Results
```
http://localhost:2322/api?q=berlin&limit=2
```

#### Adjust Language
```
http://localhost:2322/api?q=berlin&lang=it
```

#### Filter results by bounding box
Expected format is minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat. 
```
http://localhost:2322/api?q=berlin&bbox=9.5,51.5,11.5,53.5
```

#### Filter results by [tags and values](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/projects/nominatim#tags)

*Note: the filter only works on principal OSM tags and not all OSM tag/value combinations can be searched. The actual list depends on the import style used for the Nominatim database (e.g. [settings/import-full.style](https://github.com/osm-search/Nominatim/blob/master/settings/import-full.style)). All tag/value combinations with a property 'main' are included in the photon database.*
If one or many query parameters named ```osm_tag``` are present, photon will attempt to filter results by those tags. In general, here is the expected format (syntax) for the value of osm_tag request parameters.

1. Include places with tag: ```osm_tag=key:value```
2. Exclude places with tag: ```osm_tag=!key:value```
3. Include places with tag key: ```osm_tag=key```
4. Include places with tag value: ```osm_tag=:value```
5. Exclude places with tag key: ```osm_tag=!key```
6. Exclude places with tag value: ```osm_tag=:!value```

For example, to search for all places named ```berlin``` with tag of ```tourism=museum```, one should construct url as follows:
```
http://localhost:2322/api?q=berlin&osm_tag=tourism:museum
```

Or, just by they key

```
http://localhost:2322/api?q=berlin&osm_tag=tourism
```

#### Filter results by layer

List of available layers:

- house
- street
- locality
- district
- city
- county
- state
- country

```
http://localhost:2322/api?q=berlin&layer=city&layer=locality
```

Example above will return both cities and localities.
