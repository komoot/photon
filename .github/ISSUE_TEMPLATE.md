Submit a new issue only if you are sure it is a missing feature or a bug. Otherwise please discuss the topic in the [mailing list](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/photon) first. 

Before creating an issue also make sure to read our [contributing guide](https://github.com/komoot/photon/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The best way to get help about a Photon issue is to create a valid and detailed issue content, preferable with a unit or integration test reproducing the issue. Please include the version of Photon, the JVM and the operating system are you using and in case of a geocoding problem include a link to [komoot's photon instance](https://photon.komoot.de/). Also tell us your expected geocoding result.
